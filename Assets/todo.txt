Story:
The Greenies have no sense of empathy. 
The Greenies have no sense of honor. 
They will kill you as soon as look at you.
You may feel empathy towards them,
as they are living beings. 

This is a feeling you must root out of your mind. 
Empathy is a weekness.
Killing Greenies is more like taking out the trash.
They are filth.

Remember what they did on Terminus Est.
Remember Alpha Prime.
Remember the Severian systems.

Remember the colonsists.
They are no longer here to remember for themselves.

Your duty is to exterminate every last one of them.
Your duty is to distance yourself from feelings.

We are the Guardians. We are the few. 
We are what stands between mankind and oblivion.
